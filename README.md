# Origins
At first, this pack was a fork of the fanmade PSP Version, but now, I ported it to Java & Bedrock and called it **Bedrock Polishments**.

# Description:
This pack was created to make the PSP, Normal and Bedrock versions closer together. This proccess in some cases is also known as **parity**.

# Trivia:
The name *Bedrock Polishments* means *Bedrock Edition Polishments*, but the pack was later ported to the Java versions and a link for the psp pack will be available.
